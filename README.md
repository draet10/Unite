Unite (An idea for codefundo++)
===
Join People at the time of natural disaster to tackle the situation together. 

OBJECTIVE
---
       The idea is to make an app which be a consistent helper throughout the tragedy. It aims to bring the people together. Unite them. It would be easier for every to help at the time of crisis. It consist of three parts :-
       1.	Pre-Caution
       2.	On-Field
       3.	Post-Solution

•	Pre-Caution
---
       o	Weather forecasting
       o	About the locality and its History
       o	New locations lifestyle 
       o	Climate
       o	News
       o      Sending messages
       o	Precautions one can take 
       o	Suggestion keeping natural disaster management in mind
       o	Map guidance
       
In this stage the natural calamities have not yet occurred. And the prime motivation behind this stage is general awareness which clings with the users activity. This means that, suppose the user is travelling to a place then at that situation the app will respond with the weather conditions, news around the place, and about the culture of the region earlier, history of any natural calamities, lifestyle in the region , precautions that can be taken under such occurred calamities, the most optimum places the user can go under the event of that calamity in that alien land and these options are not supposed to pop out with huge contents but requires users attention for explanation.
 
The aim of this stage is also to make the app a permanent resident in the users phone. The natural disaster occur at rare occasions on macroscopic level and continuously on microscopic level. We would always be late to find out the uncertainty of the future. Many of the natural calamity victims have said, that they never have thought that they would experience such a situation. They simply don’t know properly, what they should do. Or which place would be optimum for them  or the localities they should choose. According to a research in psychology, people tend to see the brighter side more often and ignore the slightest possibility of something getting wrong. This is not an argue between optimism or pessimism but realistic thought. And a general person will tend to ignore the relevance of  one moment sided app as it is also taking up there phones storage. And we don’t expect the user to install the app at the time of crisis . 
Thus, this stage is very important in ongoing development.

•	On-Field
---
        o	What to do?
        o	Find a place.
        o	Reach the place.
        o	Ask for help.
        o	Messaging the people near user.
        o	Manage phone battery. 
        o	Give updates.
        o	Give concern to acquaintances. 
        o	Get to know if the relatives and friends are safe.
        o	Control the rush in people.
        o	Balance the crowd.
        o	Unite the people.

This is the current continuing calamity the user is facing which can activated in two ways:

The users responses to the concerns given by the app which is directed by the main server and the database adopted from the National Disaster Associations and the NEWS.The positive response will activate the app internally for the actions will be focused on the needed situation.  The app will be sub activated even if the user did not responded.

The user asked for instant help. And if the other users of that locality are asking for instant help in significant amount or depending upon the past history of that place, then also other users in that region will be given an alert. This step also joins with the upper level that is just explained.


After activation, the app will be ultra-sensitive to the requirements that could be felt. Like automatically saving battery by restricting background apps. The actions will be like finding an optimum locality for stay. For example an open space in the case of earthquake. And help them find the easiest way to reach there. 
Users can even send messages as concern to their acquaintances who are believed to be in the region of calamity. This will even help in wide spreading news related natural disaster and people will become more aware.

•	Post-Solution
---
         o	Donate
         o	Giving concern
         o	Updates
         o	Rescue the survivors
         o	News

This section will include mostly about the donation one want to give to help people to  recover the loses faced because of the catastrophe. If the phone gets discharged in active duration then the records will be saved. And it may help the rescue team to find out the survivors. 

## How it works

The working model doesnot require very sophisticated technology. It would work on any simple smart phone. The requirements are very nominal. The app would work on the input from a particular region to find out the problems they face and work on them to call for help in the genuine places. The GPS will be in use to find out the location. The map guidance feature will be used by the server analysis. At the time of catastrophe, it would create a few routes to a genuine place in a locality and finally return the most optimum path to the user. The people of a particular range will be marked differently and people could even get know where other people are. This is a simple GPS based feature. The unique id of people that are required by the people would help to identify different people and their current location. Even if the user is unable to login a particular id. He would guided with his I.P. address. People can use the donate feature by online backing, digital payment app or credit card for payment.  

## Starting

Creating an Id with a mobile number or an email id. The people can also use some benefits of the app without login. The user can then use the app. He could send messages, read news, weather forecasting and other requirements. He can donate money to the people in need, which will connect them with the NGOs and other philanthropic organisations.
