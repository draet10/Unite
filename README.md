# Unite
Join People at the time of calamities to tackle the situation together. 
The idea is to make an app which be a consistent helper through out the situtation . It consist of three parts :-
1.	Pre- Caution
2.	On- Field
3.	Post- Solution

•	Pre-Caution
In this stage the natural calamities have not yet occurred. And the prime motivation behind this stage is general awareness which clings with the users activity. This means that, suppose the user is travelling to a place then at that situation the app will respond with the weather conditions, news around the place, and about the culture of the region earlier, history of any natural calamities, lifestyle in the region , precautions that can be taken under such occurred calamities, the most optimum places the user can go under the event of that calamity in that alien land and these options are not supposed to pop out with huge contents but requires users attention for explanation.
The aim of this stage is also to make the app a permanent resident in the users phone. We would always be to late to find out the uncertainity of the future. Many of the natural calamity victims have said, that they never have thought that they would experience such a situation. They simply don’t know properly what they should do. Or which place would be optimum for them  or the localities they should choose. And according to the research in psychology, people tend to see the brighter side more often and ignore the slightest possibility of something getting wrong. This is not an argue between optimism or pessimism but realistic thought. And a general person will tend to ignore the relevance of  one moment sided app as it is also taking up there phones storage. And we don’t expect the user to install the app at the time misevent . 
Thus, this stage is very important in ongoing development.

•	On-Field
This is the current continuing calamity the user is facing which can activated in two ways:
-	The users’ responses to the concerns given by the app which is directed by the main server and the database adopted from the National Disaster Associations and the NEWS.
The positive response will activate the app internally for the actions will be focused on the needed situation.  The app will be sub activated even if the user did not responded.
-	The user asked for instant help. And if the other user’s of that locality are asking for instant help in significant amount or depending upon the past history of that place, then also other users in that region will be given an alert. This step also joins with the upper level that is just explained.
After activation of the phone will be ultra sensitive to the requirements that could be felt. Like automatically saving battery by restricting background apps. The actions will be like finding an optimum locality for stay. For example an open space in the case of earthquake. And help them find the easiest way to reach there.
